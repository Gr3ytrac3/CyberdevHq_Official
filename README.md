# The Journey of an Offensive Kernel Security Engineer in Training

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This project is more than just a website — it's a **living archive of my learning process**, lab experiments, tool development, technical documentation, and reflections as I grow into the field of **Offensive Security and Kernel Engineering**.

I’m still early in my journey, but I approach this field with **discipline, curiosity, and consistency**. Every line of code, every tool I build, and every post I publish is part of a long-term commitment to mastering both offensive and low-level system security.

>  _"Not just hacking for noise — but building with intent, breaking with precision, and documenting with clarity."_

## 🎯 Vision & Direction

This portfolio documents my growth as I work toward becoming a:

-  **Kernel Security Engineer** — with a strong foundation in Linux internals, rootkits, and memory management
-  **Red Teamer** — skilled in simulating adversaries, bypassing defenses, and building realistic labs
-  **Security Artisan** — creating custom tools, writing technical content, and sharing knowledge publicly

Everything here — the tools, the labs, the blog posts — is a reflection of serious effort, not shortcuts.
